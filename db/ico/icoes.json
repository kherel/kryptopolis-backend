			"Concept": "ACT is a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation that supports social accountability globally by aggregating micro payments from citizens to fund grass roots proposals that drive change. Social accountability can be described as the extent and capability of citizens to hold the state accountable and make it responsive to their needs. The ACT Token is a reward token that governs the distribution of 15% of platform revenue to proposal curators. Platform revenue is generated from citizens purchasing votes that can be applied within limits to proposals. Once a proposal is vetted by curators, and the community agrees to fund it through a voting round, a smart contract triggers payment. ACT can operate at any scale and any speed to drive the change we need to see."

Its aim is to build a worldwide, wireless mesh telecommunications network using Blockchain and advanced wireless network technologies. The Ammbr network will bridge the last-mile gap that is currently poorly handled by traditional Internet Service Providers, especially in less developed countries. The Ammbr network will be composed of Ammbr units, which act like advanced routers. These units mutually relay data with each other and, by doing so, they grant the end users Internet access, especially in areas where the Internet coverage is currently poor. The units use a wide range of advanced wireless technologies, allowing them to be very flexible and to cover long distances. The complexity of the device will not influence the overall user experience, which will be similar to what a current “standard” router provides when a user wants to join a LAN to connect to the Internet."

			"Concept": "The Bancor protocol is a standard that allows anyone to easily create completely liquid “smart tokens” that calculate their own prices & enable a single party to convert any token to another, without requiring a second party to exchange with. Thereby enabling the long-tail of completely liquid cryptocurrencies.\n\nSmart tokens hold other tokens in reserve, and can be used as decentralized token baskets (like ETFs), token changers (like shapeshift), project & protocol tokens (like GNT & REP), community currencies (like Ithacash & reward miles), and a lot of other use cases.\n\nThe BANCOR network token will hold a single reserve in Ether. Other smart tokens, by using BANCOR as (one of) their reserve(s), connect to the BANCOR network. \n\nThe BANCOR network token forms a monetary structure where increased demand for any of the network’s smart tokens drives up the value of the common BANCOR token, benefiting all other smart tokens holding it in reserve.",

At that, all the data concerning products is stored as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Use of smart contracts allows for automatization of payment processing and account of products. In the simplest cases, creating a digital product offer is done with only a few clicks and does not require vendors to install any software. Purchasing digital products is a simple process too. Buyers make all payments in the Ethereum blockchain`s native currency – ETH.  Creating sale offers, as well as buying products is done with the use of software, based on MyEtherWallet – one of the most popular Ethereum online wallets. That allows the service to be used on both desktops and mobile devices."

Beluga acquired an exclusive, perpetual, global license to Espiral Technologies S.A. de C.V. and their team, to expand its payment technology to new regions. Beluga will replicate their successful model in developing countries with adequate technology (smartphones), high levels of unbanked citizens and where larger, incumbent companies have not converted merchants to modern payment methods. Micro and Small businesses transact over $6.5 trillion USD annually, yet less than 10% of these merchants accept digital payments. Beluga will deliver an innovative range of products to make merchants lives easier. Their native cryptocurrency BBI, will solve real-world merchant problems and provide unique incentives. BBI token-holders receive .5% of all transaction fees and BBI can be used as gas for near-instant merchant deposits (currently card payments can take up to 2-3 working days to process.) Each BBI token can be used as membership for 1 month of Beluga Pro which offers advanced analytics and faster settlement speed than non-BBI-Gas deposits. Loyalty points will be accrued by users of the platform and can be redeemed for travel, entertainment, goods and services."

Cryptocurrency gambling accounts for roughly 5% of the entire online gambling industry.

To enhance liquidity, we propose a hybrid market of (1) frequent batch auctions and (2) an autonomous market maker. The proposed design provides users with high liquidity at all times, reduce spreads, prevent \"flash crashes\" and improve traders' welfare. BBOD system uses elliptic curves post-quantum cryptography, which is secure against all known quantum algorithms and on-chain encrypt all sensitive transaction data like price and volume. The BBOD platform makes it possible to either protect cryptocurrency investments against crashes or speculate on price changes using a wide range of digital tokens (eg. Ethereum, Qtum, GNT). The platform’s roadmap lays out its future path to develop a turnkey solution in the form of one venue for cryptocurrency owners to trade derivatives, convert and list new tokens on the market."

How it works: Blockstack is a browser extension and developer platform. Developers start by building a single-page application in Javascript then plug into user-run APIs, which eliminates a centralized point of control. Blockstack provides key tools to developers enabling access to decentralized networking, user-controlled storage, blockchain-based identities, and decentralized authentication. Personal users run decentralized apps through the Blockstack browser and grant applications read and write access as they choose. Information is encrypted and stored on users personal devices. There are no middlemen, no passwords, and no massive data silos to breach."

The advanced techniques privately secure and makes auditable the trade and finance details, ultimately allowing for a more reliable and automated trade flows to emerge.  This negates the need to for private blockchains or unnecessary data storage on a blockchain and opens up public blockchains to use cases in finance that were not previously possible.

			"Token sale opening date": "6. Apr 2017",

			"Concept": "The Cosmos network consists of many independent, parallel blockchains, called zones, each powered by classical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols like Tendermint (already used by platforms like ErisDB). Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.\nCosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\nFor example, if you wanted to trade bitcoins for ether today, you would have to sell your bitcoins for a fiat currency on an open exchange and then use that fiat currency to buy ether on another exchange. The problem is, many of our exchanges today are plagued by hacks, theft, and cons. Two prime examples are what happened at Mt. Gox and more recently Bitfinex."

During the Fire Swap (pre-ICO) the amount of 25,000,000 COSS will be released. The minimum buy-in of this offer is 50 ETH worth of COSS tokens (the exchange rate ETH to COSS will become available prior to the start of the pre-ICO) with a 25% bonus. The offer may expire anytime once all 25,000,000 COSS tokens are sold. The holders of COSS tokens will receive weekly revenues from the COSS DAO generating value out of transaction fees on the COSS platform governed by the Smart Contract System. Thus, the COSS token has inherent value attached to it since the very moment of issuance."

C20 is the fund’s token and represents an investor’s share in the fund. The smart contract allows users to withdraw the net asset value of the token instantly, or it can be freely traded on exchanges at any time, with no exit fees, broker fees or advice fees. Data science was used with extensive backtesting over many rolling windows to determine the fund hyperparameters, asset weighting allocation and rebalancing periods. Holding the perfect, data science driven proportions of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, with autonomous weekly rebalancing, is now possible by holding a single token.",

			"Concept": "The core objective behind the existence of DAO.Casino is to replace centralised casino models with a socio-economic protocol with no human intervention whatsoever. This decentralized system will achieve a fine balance between active participation and a fair economic return for those who participate. For developers, DAO.Casino proposes to eliminate their need to rely on centralized casinos. Instead, the protocol makes it easier for these talented individuals and teams to monetise their work, raise funds, and expect bankrolling without paying heavy commissions.For gamers, DAO.Casino is equally attractive, as it allows them to break free from rigged centralised online casinos. Traditional casinos are a black box; players cannot call their bluff easily, because the outcomes of each bet are calculated behind closed curtains. DAO.Casino, on the other hand, allows for transparency. The protocol focuses on obtaining pseudorandomness in all the gaming outcomes by introducing an economic incentive layer. Here, the participants interact with PRNG contracts to ensure unpredictable pseudorandomness. In the beginning we expect existing licensed online casino operators to integrate with the protocol to reduce costs, while long-term new forms of regulations more suitable for decentralised, transparent and automated systems can emerge."

			"Concept": "DAO IPCI is an already-working decentralized blockchain ecosystem that allows businesses and individuals, governments and NGOs to join or launch autonomous environmental mitigation programs, and bridge them to monetize all types of environmental assets. This should help raise green finance needed for reaching below 2 C Paris Agreement aim and UN sustainable development goals. The DAO IPCI ecosystem allows diverse stakeholders (governments, civil society, businesses and individuals) to participate directly in mitigation activities, register quantified commitments, invest in green projects, offset carbon footprint, acquire and trade mitigation outcomes.From its launch in early 2016 DAO IPCI has brought together experienced blockchain and green finance developers along with globally renowned experts who formed the advisory board. Minimum necessary functional of the DAO IPCI protocol and decentralized application have been in place since late 2016.  Several months later DAO IPCI reached a historical milestone - the very first world - wide carbon credit transaction using blockchain technology.\nMitigation Token (MITO) is a protocol-based ERC20 token acting as market exchange vehicle, designed to represent environmental and climate mitigation costs including carbon price.\nAt the post-token sale stage strict correlation of the MITO and 3-rd party verified environmental mitigation assets will be ensured, hedging price volatility of green finance markets. New MITO issues will be only possible one year after the Initial Token Offering, whilst 50% of newly issued tokens shall be distributed among existing MITO holders."

DisLedger’s patent pending technology provides a solution for permissioned networks that handle high volumes of transactions, require low-latency, and must maintain data privacy. It is a different approach to the way the data is distributed, more akin to sharding or striping than the massively redundant replication of all data copied to all nodes. DisLedger doesn’t compete with permissionless, completely transparent networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum but offers an alternative where the use-case calls for speed and privacy."

			"Concept": "The district0x Network is a collective of marketplaces and communities, which we refer to as districts. Districts exist as decentralized autonomous organizations on the district0x Network. All districts will be built upon a standard open-source framework, d0xINFRA. Modeled after the Ethlance stack, the d0xINFRA framework is comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries. To provide all internet citizens with an opportunity to freely join and contribute to any district, to align incentives across all of a district’s participants, and to implement coordinated decision-making mechanisms to the district0x Network, they introduce the district0x Network Token. The district0x Network Token (DNT) is a staking token, used by holders to join districts and participate in their governance. Upon staking district0x Network Tokens to a district, participants receive an equivalent amount of voting rights in the district. Voting rights can be used to partake in the processes that determine everything from a district’s branding, to its accepted code of conduct, to the auxiliary modules that are integrated, to the way that fees collected by revenue-generating auxiliary modules are utilized, and beyond."

			"Concept": "They are already using Ethereum blockchain to eliminate centralized ticket sales, counterfeit ticketing and excessive processing fees. Our EventChain alpha is already live to purchase tickets using EventChain tokens (EVC) on the Ethereum testnet blockchain. The cost of processing a ticketing transaction on our network averages 5 cents or less, significantly cheaper than the current ticketing systems available. The Alpha Decentralized application has a “web2 sidechain” to harness these technological benefits with little technical expertise and is also fully functioning on desktop and mobile devices and also a web 3 backend for coders to be able to create events and sell or buy tickets using command lines. With EventChain, there will be no counterfeit tickets, overpriced resale markup, and no excessive processing fees in the event industry anymore"

The exchange is fully working with 13 cryptocurrencies and 169 trading pairs. It is very easy to use and much more private than any of the competitors.  With Flyp.me, anyone can instantly exchange 13 cryptocurrencies straight to their wallet. Private by design, users are always in control of their data. Flyp.me aims to rebalance the power between users of an exchange and the exchange itself, by sharing 50% of the profits made by the exchange and implementing distributed policy-making to enable token holders to propose new features or coin additions, vote for key decisions and audit volumes.  Flyp.me has also released an API that already enables businesses and developers to accept payments in 13 cryptocurrencies, with many more in the next few months. Flyp.me is built and managed by the team at HolyTransaction, one of the first web wallets to support Ethereum, the first multi-currency web wallet and the oldest still active. Flyp.me is doing an ICO to fund the decentralization of the exchange, drive its adoption and increase the reserves of each cryptocurrency. The roadmap includes R&D for 2nd layer solutions, the integration of decentralized asset platforms and cryptographic auditing."

The digital goods transactions will take place using a crypto-token called \"FLIP\". Globally, gamers purchase over US$100 billion of digital goods each year. Most of these digital goods are locked within individual games, and gamers lose all of their value when they stop playing that game. The current infrastructure does not promote the liquidity, transparency or security required by gamers to buy, sell and trade digital goods. The FLIP token will leverage the Ethereum blockchain and ERC-20 token interface. This infrastructure and the FLIP smart contracts will eliminate questions of trust and protect the transacting gamers from fraud. Game developers and publishers will be given open-sourced plug-ins and software development kits (SDKs) from Gameflip for integration."

Genaro has pioneered the concept of Blockchain 3.0, a platform built around the first Turing-complete public chain with decentralized storage network. This means blockchain developers have a one-stop solution to deploy smart contracts and store data simultaneously.  The technological ecosystem will contribute to blockchain infrastructure technology development and is supported by a series of Hubs with an in-house Accelerator, being established in Singapore, Shanghai, and Silicon Valley. This combined system of technology standards and infrastructure will enable incubation of hundreds, and then thousands, of decentralized applications (DAPPs) built on the Genaro Network, becoming the first app store of the blockchain. The Genaro Public Chain uses PoS (Proof of Stake) as consensus, and creatively uses the SPoR (Sentinel Proof of Retrievability) algorithm as its storage consensus, which could increase both public chain scalability and file transferring speed. Moreover, Genaro applies game theory to a sharing economy business model, thereby establishing a fairer rewards system for nodes and provides end users with a private, efficient, economic, secure and permanent storage space and sharing community."

There are many marketplaces where individuals can buy and sell goods and services, but the delivery logistics are typically left to more traditional means like postal services, UPS or FedEx. Likewise, many peer-to-peer logistics systems have sprung up in recent years that enable transportation of goods while circumventing traditional delivery services at a far lower cost. However, these marketplaces and systems are all fragmented, and there has yet to be a single platform that combines them in a way that is open and transparent."

The platform operates through the use of Decision Tokens (HST).  Horizon State’s use of blockchain technology addresses the security of the vote. Data stored on the blockchain itself is distributed and tamper-proof - not owned by any individual or institution - there is no way to alter it.  Planning and executing geographically centralised votes is long and expensive - and infrequent as a result. Paired with blockchain, Horizon State delivers convenient voting to mobiles and PCs, with immediacy. Traditional methods of voting cost taxpayers upwards of $7 per vote to facilitate- $25 in some cases. Horizon State’s blockchain voting solution is far cheaper, remaining under $0.50."

Making use of smart contracts will allow Hubii Network to fix fundamental pain points in the content industry and apply mechanisms never seen before in the market. All this will be delivered whilst having full transparency, accountability and security over the transactions using a new cryptocurrency, Hubiits (HUB).\n The goal is for the entire Hubii Network to be open source and decentralised in nature."

			"Symbol": "JVY",
			"Token sale opening date": "1. Nov 2017",
			"Token sale closing date": "15. Nov 2017",
			"Concept": "Javvy is a secure, comprehensive crypto exchange with wallet solution (not web-based) that will support all expected operations for all major cryptocurrencies and tokens. It will earn revenue from buy/sell fees, conversion fees, international debit card fees, and merchant settlement fees. Users should not worry about finding or trusting unproven crypto exchanges, which are mostly web-based and insecure. They should simply be able to install the Javvy application and immediately begin buying, selling, managing, and using all major cryptocurrencies within a single, safe, and secure application. The early adopters will be crypto-savvy users, likely already using competing exchanges and wallets. Eventually, they will expand into mainstream markets, due to the ease-of-use of our solution that other exchanges and wallets have failed to provide --despite hundreds of millions invested and many years to do so."

They are the first protocol to allow anyone to put traditional assets like currencies, bonds, and other financial instruments on the blockchain in a form of Crypto Depository Receipts (CryDRs). Our CryDRs have smart regulation built in; real-world rules and regulations are translated into solidity code to ensure that while decentralized, tokenized financial assets always follow real world rules and regulations."

Every user, event, and ticket have unique ID which is registered on blockchain. Each event has a marketing pool where vendors can allocate KCY tokens for reward-based marketing. Once the campaign is launched, any user can click on the event and smart contract generates a unique link for the user. The User can then share this link with his friends on social media and get rewarded when there is a conversion (ticket sales or registration).

We believe this is directly related to a substantial barrier to entry in acquiring cryptocurrencies and the lack of acceptance as a method of tender. The Latium Platform solves these issues by creating an easy to use market place where anyone willing to complete a task is rewarded with LAT tokens, making cryptocurrencies available to all. LAT can also be used for task creation, meaning that anyone needed a task completed can now use LAT to pay for the labor. This also gives LAT an intrinsic value within the system rather than the purely speculative value given to most cryptocurrencies and tokens."

That means every LSK holder can vote for mainchain delegates which are securing the network. There are only a maximum of 101 active mainchain delegates which always got the most votes on the whole network, and only they can earn block generation rewards, that means there is a financial incentive to become an active delegate. Every other delegate is on standby awaiting to become elected, or alternatively, securing a Lisk sidechain."

			"Concept": "Lordmancer II encourages using of a cryptocurrency token named Lord Coin (LC) as a payment method for player-to-player trades, facilitating sale of a unique or rare game content. LC tokens can enter the game economy only after being purchased at a cryptocurrency exchange. They can be taken out of the game later and sold for a cryptocurrency. Game developers will provide players who are not familiar with cryptocurrency world with convenient ways to purchase LCs for fiat currencies."

Monero seeks to provide absolute transactional privacy in an effort to create true electronic cash. With Bitcoin, as well as with the vast majority of cryptocurrencies that have been established since, any and all transactions are entirely traceable. Any casual observer can read through the Bitcoin blockchain, and for any transaction, this observer can find out the exact amount that was transacted, as well as the precise transaction origin (sender address) and destination (recipient address)."

Their platform has an open interface for 3rd party developers: everyone can send a contract and after a security audit, It will be listed on the platform. The Platform Tokens (WISH) are used for the creation of contracts and for external calls motivation during the whole contract’s life (Joule system).

This decentralized system of securely storing transactions is the future of database technology for global networks. Enterprise applications taking advantage of this technology gain numerous benefits over those using traditional database architectures including transaction immutability, transparency, security, reliability, and decentralization. Despite the maturity of blockchain networks, few applications have taken advantage of the technology due to the difficulty, and cost of integration and maintenance. Unlike legacy blockchain networks, next-generation blockchain networks such as Neblio will fill the huge gap in the enterprise market to simplify the development and deployment of distributed applications that drive business value through blockchain technology."

As with Peercoin, proof-of-stake replaces proof-of-work as NeuCoin’s consensus mechanism, effectively replacing the operating costs of Bitcoin miners (electricity, computers) with the capital costs of holding the currency. Proof-of-stake also avoids proof-of-work’s inherent tendency towards centralization resulting from competition for coinbase rewards among miners based on lowest cost electricity and hash rate.\n\nNeuCoin increases security relative to Peercoin and other existing proof-of-stake currencies in numerous ways."

All keys are created locally on user’s device and never sent to any server. \nUsers control their private keys, can send and receive funds, export wallet, and encrypt the wallet with a password or seed phrase. Developers can develop and add new assets through an open plugins system keeping the wallet lightweight. The second component is a validator hosted on the Safenetwork. Users will connect to the Safenetwork through the wallet to exchange. An application will match the orders issued by the users and check all transactions and order informations are valid. Unlike centralized and semi-centralized exchanges, there isn’t a wallet acting as a relay. Transactions are processed simultaneously through an order matching engine from one wallet to another. The validator on the Safenetwork will check if the transactions are valid prior to being exchanged. The orders are then matched and transactions broadcasted in their respective networks. The validator process raw transactions and doesn’t hold any private keys or assets nor can it sign transactions resulting in a trustless decentralized exchange using the Safenetwork to validate orders."

Users and couriers \"sign\" the smart contract as owners of objects and have no legal obligation because of the smart contract. On the other hand, because objects do not lie and can be tracked, delivery smart contracts can check delivery conditions in a flexible, trustless and automatic way. For instance, the delivery conditions can foresee to reduce the return of deposit by 10% per day after a predefined date. The smart contract applies delivery rules with no need to go to court or make a complaint to insurance company."

The platform challenges Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion’s status quo by assessing businesses credit risk profiles through a built-in algorithm that accounts 150 data points from live financial data hashed on the Ethereum blockchain. PayPie is a faster, safer, and smart contract-powered credit scoring and lending platform for banks, lenders, and invoice factoring companies. The platform solves the problems of fraud and inconsistencies which exist in isolated accounting systems by allowing for real-time audit and analysis of financial statements on the blockchain. This analysis will be done using a decentralized single ledger approach and will consider the all-time historical accounting information of participating businesses to safeguard and transform the way credit risk is assessed by lenders, investors, and other financial institutions. All inputs will be bound to the blockchain in a triple entry accounting structure, which will secure the entire transaction-checking process generating reliable and unbiased data."

Eventually, we believe this wallet will power most devices, including phones, tablets, wearables, cars, buildings, and more. The project will build an open-source, multi-chain wallet that will provide a new digital platform for consumers, companies, and governments."

Polkadot ensures that each of these blockchains remains secure and that any dealings between them are faithfully executed.

			"Concept": "Pylon is a network structured with only one purpose: to create the first open renewable energy exchange community, which will provide the energy markets with the signals and financial incentives that current energy policies and governance systems are failing to provide. Users of Pylon can exchange green energy, bought directly from the RES producer and without need for intervention of intermediaries throughout the process; this is achieved through the application of blockchain technology and smart contracts. At the same time,  Pylon-Coin, which will be used for payment of all green energy transactions, is utilized within the financial eco-system that we are proposing (the Pylon Network), in order to reward the production of sustainable energy and financially support projects on sustainable technologies."

They have launched a demo for the first piece of the platform, Qchain Advertising, which is an application focused on connecting digital advertisers and content publishers through an advanced direct buy marketplace. Their flagship application is a direct buy marketplace that makes it easy and simple for advertisers to transact in native ad units, a branch of digital advertising that's rapidly expanding. This would greatly benefit publishers and content creators, advertisers, and everyday Internet users alike. They are also in the process of developing our second application, Qchain Surveys, which will provide an enterprise paid survey service for marketers, pollsters, and academics to inform their research. They will add applications in the future as we see fit to fill out the platform and fulfill or aims of building an entire end-to-end ecosystem for digital marketers and advertisers who want to run their whole workflow on blockchain technology."

Unlike existing ledgers, such as bitcoin or ethereum, the QRL is specially designed to use a form of post-quantum secure signature for transactions called XMSS.\nThe QRL also uses a low power proof-of-stake (POS) algorithm which again utilises iterative hash-chains and provably secure hash-based pseudo random number functions. The POS algorithm is designed to have zero reliance upon conventional signatures which are vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful QC and allows nodes to run on low power devices such as raspberry PI’s or laptops and passively earn income by staking."

Apart from placing auction lots, it is possible to place an ordinary advertisements there. The platform consists of the web-site and applications for Android and iOS. The system includes functions for calculating the trip time from the rented real estate to the tenant’s desired location (e.g. the place of work), calculating an optimal real estate price (based on the data analysis), 3D images of the rooms, a user account for exchanging receipts for services and chatting between the landlord and the tenant, and other functions. The user account and the chat are provided by subscription. The platform will offer an opportunity to pay the rent in its own cryptocurrency – REST that can be converted into fiat money on your card and vice versa in the user account. The user will be able to add his bank card to carry-out operations with fiat; the exchange process will be backed by integration with the crypto-exchange. The advantage of this platform is payment with REST without commissions as distinguished from bank wire transfers."

It's the security-focused solution for authentication of employees, customers and smart devices, that lets businesses protect user accounts from stealing and provides secure  access to sensitive data. Instead of a password, REMME provides a specific SSL certificate for each device and browser. The certificate data is managed on Blockchain, so a fake certificate will never work. Inbuilt 2FA options are based on widely spread apps and work with bots, developed for the most popular messenger apps. Instead of messangers, a dedicated mobile app could be used for 2FA according to internal security policies."

			"Concept": "With recent advances in peer-to-peer data distribution and blockchain technology, Rex will provide universal access to real estate information and streamline the transaction process.Rex will start by building a global multiple listing service, creating a data layer that is accessible to everyone. The database will minimize listing fees and maximize listing exposure. In our third phase, Rex will provide users the ability to create sale and lease “smart” contracts. Benefits include a savings on time, communication, and administrative costs. Finally, Rex will develop an architecture to create tokenized contracts with an exchange where property tokens can be traded."

A cosigner acts as a reinsurer that distributes and reduces the lender’s risk and, at the same time, helps to improve the contract conditions by retaining access to the borrower’s local legal system."

Revisit ROSECODE and each time you will find new clues and meet new characters with their own secrets and hidden motives.

The creators dare to ask, \"What if creative projects worked the same way as open source software?\" Every science fiction fan is familiar with the concept of \"franchises\" like Marvel, DC, and Star Wars. ROSECODE uses the power of Creative Commons licensing to forge a new paradigm: a shared mythos where anyone is free to invent, tell stories, build games, or film a movie—for fun or for profit. ROSECODE will be the first science fiction universe that belongs to fans"

Users of the Sharpe Platform earn Ether rewards in exchange for their opinions about global equity markets. Backed by the Sharpe proprietary investment fund, rewards are paid to holders of SHP tokens on a quarterly basis. The Sharpe proprietary investment fund utilises cutting edge Machine Learning technology to deliver returns that consistently beat the stock market, with low volatility and an excellent Sharpe ratio (typically 2.5+). Their trading ledger smart contract maintains a real-time public record of all investment activity on the blockchain, such that sentiment rewards can be paid to token holders in a decentralised and autonomous way. Subject to obtaining regulatory sign-off, they will be a blockchain start-up to issue a fully-regulated crypto-security token. They plan to issue Sharpe Crypto-Derivative (SCD) tokens to all holders of SHP, at a rate of 1-to-1. SCD will be a dividend-paying token, which tracks the performance of the Sharpe proprietary fund and pays an Ether profit-share to token holders on a biannual basis.",

			"Symbol": "SIGS",
			"Token sale opening date": "8. Dec 2017",
			"Token sale closing date": "29. Dec 2017",
			"Concept": "The Signal Token Protocol enables advertisers to execute ad campaigns by directly rewarding the producers, providers, and influencers of attention – rather than going through a centralized intermediary broker. This is achieved through Ad Campaign Smart Contracts initiated by advertisers. This protocol is developed for any ad-driven media platform to use and build upon; video-based, audio-based, written, or mixed. This means that the Signal Token utility is not fixed to Spectiv. Rather, it is built to be its own decentralized, autonomous protocol that can support multiple attention economies. Each media platform can integrate its own unique mechanisms for monitoring genuine attention data, contributing to the long-term effectiveness of the protocol. Decentralized protocols make great sense in theory, but are often faced with a fatal challenge when applied to the real world: early adoption. Without a dedicated early adopter to champion a new product, it can be extremely difficult to generate traction and compete with established players. Spectiv serves as the pioneer and first use case for the Signal Token Protocol. Spectiv’s mission is to become the foundational layer for connecting and transacting rewards between advertisers, publishers, curators and viewers across a variety of platforms, the first of which is Spectiv VR."

The use of blockchain- technologies destroys the boundaries between sellers and buyers, allowing the creation of a unique open trading platform with infinite growth potential. Keeping in line with the cutting edge in the e-commerce field, Storiqa will be running all transactions exclusively as smart contracts to ensure maximum security (as the seller will receive the funds only when the buyer confirms the delivery). Moreover, in the future, the platform will be further augmented by Android and iOS customer apps that will make shopping a quick and simple experience. In addition, we also plan to introduce multicurrency wallets with an option to shop using the cryptocurrency that is independent from any fluctuations of the fiat currency exchange rates. Storiqa will make “2-click” purchases possible in any part of the world."

Storj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows users to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security. Furthermore, it will be way cheaper (10x-to-100x), faster, and more secure than traditional cloud storage services.\nStorj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, Storj Share, and Libstorj. It is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure online files. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation."

Because Tezos has a built-in consensus mechanism, its protocol can evolve, and incorporate new innovations over time, without the risk of hard forks splitting the market. Tezos is its own blockchain, not a derivative of any other blockchain. We didn’t just fork Bitcoin or Ethereum and add a layer onto it. We built our own from the ground up. Their smart contract language makes it easier to apply formal verification to any smart contract running on the Tezos blockchain. This allows developers to rule out weaknesses in code before uploading that code on the blockchain.\nTezos relies on a less onerous, less computationally intensive, and less power-consuming proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, where bonded stakeholders validate transactions."

By using the blockchain to achieve transparency, Kudos will bring trust in ratings through cryptographically verified transactions that cannot be manipulated by ads or algorithms—the shift will also help eliminate tipping discrimination. As the service and marketplace economies have boomed, much of the wealth created has remained in the hands of the platform owners and investors. Tips and rewards have been misaligned which creates inconsistent experiences on both sides. Kudos solves this problem by rewarding users and workers based on their actual performance and usage. Kudos will become essential infrastructure for businesses across all service economies today — from ridesharing to coffee shops to restaurants — and become the backbone of web 3.0 and the blockchain-based businesses of tomorrow."

Important points here are that token holders will be able to vote on all strategic decisions, including, but not limited to quarterly budgets, strategic goals and board members. Within the same platform users will be able to communicate with different charities, verified well-doers and people who aim to make a change in their community. The platform will let you see to what extent a certain well-doer or charity is accountable and transparent. The goal of the Opakeco Foundation is to have charities use Karmo tokens to buy food, medical supplies and other necessities – this can range from building water wells and houses to providing solar-powered lights – that help their cause."

If tickets to an event are sold out, consumers typically turn to the secondary market to source their tickets.  On the secondary market, they also pay high fees and risk fraud due to the lack of transparency. TokenStub’s blockchain-based decentralized ticketing platform provides natural solutions to many of these challenges and promises a fair, efficient and secure marketplace for both buyers and sellers."

They want the value to be shared between those that really matter - the guests and the hotels. The premise is simple, once guests have completed their stay they receive a kickback in the form of the native Trippki token, TRIP. TRIP are reward point tokens, but as crypto assets they can be spent or traded at the owner's discretion. So they are unlike any other reward system. Each TRIP given as a reward is recorded in the rewards ledger allowing users to build reputation on the platform and with specific hotels. This gives the traveler freedom whilst allowing hotels to tailor specific offers to their customers."

Whereas SatoshiDICE was somewhat decentralised, vDice is fully decentralised. vDice leverages the power of Ethereum smart contracts to build a game that has no server architecture. Instead, bets are processed through an Oracle, using the 3rd party services of random.org for the random number source.\nThe Smart Contracts are live, network tested, and processing bets on a continuous basis."

WePower token is backed green energy and grows in real value. Token accrues energy from renewable energy producers who have to donate part of the energy produced to the token holders. WPR token holders can use or sell donated green energy, which provides liquidity.  WePower token model was clarified with the regulator and don't fall under financial/securities law regulation. WePower already attracted the first clients with 1,650 MW capacity solar plants in Spain and Italy (WePower launch markets).",

The oligopolistic nature of the travel industry allows for superior margins, double marginalization, and inhibits competition. Today hotels pay up to 25% fees of the total booking value to intermediaries who hold a duopoly on travel distribution. Winding Tree gives the distribution power back to the individual hotels and airlines. Moving data around and charging for that service may have been a business model in 70s but is wholly outdated today. Blockchain allows for a truly free and competitive platform in the travel industry. Having previously started a successful travel startup we have great connections in the industry and are actively talking to some of the largest players in travel."

The rewards and benefits of producing enterprise-grade Open-Source software have largely been muted by the lack of monetization for Open Source, leaving highly skilled Open-Source developers without a way to harvest the true value of their work.\nThe focal point of Wireline will be a microservices exchange: an opportunity for the vast community of Open-Source developers to monetize enterprise-focused projects; a marketplace for businesses to discover, test and integrate microservices that can be seamlessly combined to build customized solutions. Wireline has developed the necessary infrastructure to host and operate these systems, and the platform to support this community."

			"Concept": "Xaurum Gamma is a commonwealth of the first crypto smart-street. It is composed of six luxury villas on the island Krk in Croatia, a prime tourist real-estate. The goal of Xaurum projects is to preserve and increase value. The investments must therefore be long-term, relatively safe, yield the most profit and be augmentable by speculation. Real-estate is a safe investment, especially in a touristic setting. However, the time required for profitability makes it infeasible for small investors and crypto can mitigate this downside. The creation of Xaurum Gamma, a crypto-asset that represents half of the profit (and accumulates it in xaurum), creates a way for investors to benefit from speculation. It avoids its potential downside by employing scarcity (the number of Xaurum Gamma tokens is limited), guaranteeing a minimal value through its use (Xaurum Gamma tokens can be used to rent a villa at the rate 1 XGM : 100 € or higher when recapitalized) and the growth of its xaurum reserves."

Multi-hash mining creates robust incentives for miners to deliver efficient, reliable security.\nZen smart contracts are written and secured by a subset of the F* functional programming language, allowing users to: \nA) Prove the amount of resources a contract will consume and provide the necessary fees for running the contract to miners, removing the need for a “gas” based system.\nB) Prove their contracts meet a given specification, meaning they can prove the contract will definitely do (or not do) something given a specific set of parameters.\nThe Zen platform comes with a built-in solution for oracles, which provide contracts with useful real world data.\nFinally, Zen is integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing contracts to observe and respond to native bitcoin transactions"

			"Concept": "Zipper’s mission is to make cryptocurrencies and dapps easy and secure to use for everyday smartphone users. At first, they aim to fix the biggest pain point for cryptocurrency users today by making one’s private key and identity management easy and safe. Over time, they aim to become the \"iOS of the decentralized world\", providing smartphone users seamless blockchain experiences while still being in control of their data. Zipper is more than just an app of top of Android; it's an isolated software compartment which the smartphone’s OS don’t have access to. Zipper keeps user’s data and wallet secure and fully in her control, while still easily accessible. Zipper and its users are powered by the ZIP token, which is used to reward users for their attention and to curate content and incentivise developers. They are collaborating with Jolla (www.jolla.com) to bring the first Zipper-powered Sony Xperia phones to the hands of pioneer community members in March 2018. And then, scale through device partnerships. Our past is from Nokia and Jolla (Sailfish OS), so they do know our way around mobile software/OS and have rather wide contact networks in the industry."
